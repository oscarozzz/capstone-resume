    <p>
        As an IT Analyst with over 8 years of experience, I have worked in both limited companies and not for
        profit organizations which has given me experience of a variety of company cultures and business
        priorities. I am dependable, friendly and approachable and happy to work flexibly to suit the
        requirements of the job. I’m looking for a challenging post where I can learn new and build on my
        existing skills and experience
